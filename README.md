# babelfish-demo
An ugly copy/paste spaghetti plate of near-live speech translation

# Quickstart

- put your Google Translate API key in `index.html` (look for `api_key`)
- serve the static file (on OS X: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
- visit localhost:8000, select a listening language and dialect, click on the mic (allow the page to access your mic) and speak
- your speech in the selected language will be translated to Romanian and read out to you
- ???

# Disclaimer

This is the ugliest of copy/paste jobs and heavily uses webkit-only APIs. As such, it only works in the newest versions of Chrome. 

Consider this a very rudimentary proof of concept only!
